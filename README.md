This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
The aim of the app is to make use of Next.js and TailwindCSS together with very simplistic premises: making a note taking app.
I voluntarily chose to not make the notes persistent, so as to focus on the implementation of the interface with TailwindCSS and react-spring without bothering with backend features.
The primary features I worked on and implemented are:  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;📱 **Mobile first design and responsive layout for desktop**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✨ **Overlays and transitions**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🌜 **Dark mode and component themes**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;👁 **Accessibility (color contrast and keyboard navigation)**  

## Prerequisites

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 8.0 or greater installed on your system.

## Setup
